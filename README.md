xcode-build-to-device
=====================

this humble script will build your xcode project to your iphone if you are in the root directory of your project.

In other words, if this is a titanium project called mycoolapp then 
when you do pwd...
You should see this:
mycoolapp/build/iphone


also you might need to chmod +x build2phone.sh
